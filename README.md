## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
lm_model = lm(Class_num ~ Duration, data=GermanCredit)
coefs = coefficients(lm_model)
intercept = coefs[1]
slope = coefs[2]
```


**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for beginner to intermediate-level data scientists, undergraduate to masters-level students, and early to mid-senior data scientists or analysts looking to expand their knowledge of machine learning by exploring various R libraries. Basic knowledge of linear algebra and data modeling is a must.	

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-14).


### Software and Hardware List

To get the most out of this book, it’s advisable to have a basic understanding of programming, ideally
in R, although a strong foundation in any programming language should suffice. Familiarity with
elementary statistics and mathematical concepts will also be beneficial, as the book delves into statistical
methods and mathematical models. While the book is structured to guide you from foundational to
advanced topics, prior exposure to data analysis techniques will enhance your learning experience. If you’re new to R, you may want to spend some extra time on the initial chapters to become comfortable with the programming environment and syntax.

System requirements are mentioned in the following table:

| Software/Hardware                              | Operating System requirements      |
| ------------------------------------           | -----------------------------------|
| R                                              | Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (Any) |
